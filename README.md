## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m **Ryan R Brown**, a software engineer who thrives on solving problems, building creative web experiences, and continuously learning.

I transitioned into tech to pursue a career that offers growth, flexibility, and the chance to create things that make a real impact. I come from a background in restaurant management, but I found my true passion in software development—where I get to think critically, face new challenges every day, and build tools that matter.

Outside of coding, I’m a competitive track runner turned rock climber and distance runner. I live by the mindset:  
> **"The sooner you embrace discomfort, the sooner it becomes your strength."**  
It’s what drives my learning, fuels my persistence, and keeps me pushing forward.
