👋 About Me
Hi, I’m Ryan R Brown, a software engineer who thrives on solving problems, building creative web experiences, and continuously learning.

I transitioned into tech to pursue a career that offers growth, flexibility, and the chance to create things that make a real impact. I come from a background in restaurant management, but I found my true passion in software development—where I get to think critically, face new challenges every day, and build tools that matter.

One of my favorite projects is CodeCracker, a Django-based coding game that helps users sharpen their skills with interactive challenges pulled from platforms like LeetCode. It features performance tracking, secure design, and a thoughtful approach to user experience. I’ve also rebuilt my personal blog using React (via Vite) and TailwindCSS, transitioning from Django to a JavaScript stack to better explore modern frontend patterns and gain more flexibility in UI development.

Outside of coding, I’m a competitive track runner turned rock climber and distance runner. I live by the mindset:

"The sooner you embrace discomfort, the sooner it becomes your strength."
It’s what drives my learning, fuels my persistence, and keeps me pushing forward.
